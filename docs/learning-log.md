# Learning Log - M1A3 GitHub Repository Management

**Student:** Nicholas Salas  
**Date:** 10/26/25

## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- How to create a repository and create files within
- How to re-run workflows
- How to submit bugs, enhancements and documentation issues
- Issues helps teammates collaborate by providing a clear and simple method of discussing issues with a workflow regarding specific topics.
- Documentation is important to understand what has been done with the repository and any changes that have been made to the workflow.

## Challenges and Solutions
I had trouble figuring out the GitHub Actions. It took me awhile to realize where I needed to re-run the action, but now that I know where its at and how to get to that point, it should not be a problem. 

## Connection to My GIS Career
GitHub skills are important to my GIS career because collaboration is a big component. It allows people to contribute to a project in different ways. This assignment also mirrors real projects and it will help me grow in that aspect.

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
